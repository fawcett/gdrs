gdrs
====

This is a test instance of a GDRS on GitHub.  The purpose of this is to demonstrate the potential viability of creating a read-only GDRS instance on GitHub. If successful, this would allow for the harvesting of this data into the GDRS system and a viable option to allow non-GDRS members to publish datasets to the MN Geospatial Commons.
